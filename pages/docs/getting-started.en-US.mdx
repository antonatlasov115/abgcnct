## üå®Geographical location, climate

Abagansky nasleg is one of 14 rural settlements in the administrative-territorial composition of the Amginsky ulus (district) of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) of the Russian Federation. The area of the settlement is 158,806.87 hectares, the population is 1200 people, the center is c. Abakan, with two settlements: Yemelyanovka, Khvalynka. It is located about 25 km south of the city center of Abakan.One of the largest settlements of the Amginsky district, the Amga River flows through the territory of the native Abaginsky district, which flows into the Red Sea. But the river bends so beautifully three times that, dotted with rocks, blooming glades and meadows dotted with birches and pines, it becomes the pride of our settlement. This is how the local historian D. S. Longinov described this event:‚Äù ... he's coming‚Äù from bast shoes", passes "on spots", blocking the way from the pine forest, "circles" under the "snow", finds a "mountain of Earth", "turns around" and "reaches" Jersey""...
## üå®Abaga climate

The climate of the ulus is sharply continental . This is manifested in the difference in air temperatures in the winter and summer months. This can be seen on the climatodiagram of the Amman weather station and on the indicator "Wind Rose", indicating the direction of the wind. (But the atlas of sacred places. Page 14) " big winter frosts are replaced by suddenly coming warm days with dense clouds and snow.this is due to the passage of warm moist air. The January cold snap unexpectedly warmed to -13.5 C (1957).summer is short, the hottest month is July, with a maximum of heat from +17.8 C to + 39 C (1942,2019,2020). Thus, the Amginsky district is among the warm regions of Yakutia.The main reason is that when the air temperature rises in summer, a stream of warmer air passes through central Yakutia. Meanwhile, freezing (freezing) is also happening. This is due to the fact that cold air flows come from the Arctic, whereas - 0.7 C (In 1957), - 11C (in 2007). Precipitation is different, but not the same. Precipitation in summer (June, July, August) they make up 46.5%, in autumn (September, October, November) 25.5%, in winter (December, January, February) 13.8%, in spring (March, April, May) 14.2%. Snow cover lasts 204 days, and frost‚Äìfree - 64 days, but unlike winter, from October to March it costs 55-65 days with fog. The natural feature of fog consists mainly in December and January. The air passing through the territory of the district is humid, so fog forms when cold weather sets in. But why such a climate?:

The area is located far from the Atlantic Ocean, so the North Atlantic air masses come very dry and with low humidity, with higher temperatures in summer and lower in winter.
Humid and warm air masses sometimes come from the Pacific Ocean and its seas. They set warm days in winter and rainy days in summer. Their free entry into the area is hindered by mountains and anticyclonic air masses stretching in the western part of the republic.
Sometimes Arctic, cold, low-cloud moist air masses penetrate into central Yakutia and bring strong night frosts.
The terrain plays an important role in the climate of the ulus. The Amur region lies in a narrow but deep Amur basin (pit).
